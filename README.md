## 🎯 Mission

Preventing the strategic defeat of the United States Air Force due to a catastrophic 12,000 pilot deficit. ARES transforms dormant aircraft into active defensive assets through graduated AI autonomy.

## 📊 The Crisis

- **14,486** U.S. military aircraft
- **-12,000** PILOT DEFICIT  
- **74%** of fleet effectively grounded
- **26%** actual force readiness
- **$5.6M** cost to train one pilot
- **3 years** minimum training timeline

**Strategic Reality**: China (3,304 aircraft) and Russia (4,221 aircraft) know we can't fly 10,000+ of our jets. Every day of inaction multiplies their advantage.

## 💡 The Solution

ARES provides a modular AI co-pilot system that:
- Reduces pilot workload by 60-70%
- Enables single-pilot operation of two-seat aircraft
- Installs in 48-72 hours using existing maintenance facilities
- Costs $3M per unit (vs $80M+ for new aircraft)
- Graduated autonomy: human-controlled in peacetime, defensive autonomy when under attack

## 🛡️ Key Safety Features

### Human Override Always Available
- Physical kill switch for instant manual control
- Voice command override ("Manual Override")
- Automatic disengagement on conflicting inputs

### Graduated Weapons Authority
- **Level 1**: Human authorization required (peacetime)
- **Level 2**: AI may return fire when attacked
- **Level 3**: AI engages confirmed hostiles
- **Level 4**: Full defensive autonomy under overwhelming attack
- Nuclear systems remain physically isolated

### Triple Redundancy
- Primary AI system
- Backup AI system  
- Independent watchdog monitor
- Voting logic for critical decisions

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Core Hardware
- **Compute**: NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin (275 TOPS)
- **Sensors**: LIDAR, Radar, IR, Enhanced GPS
- **Interface**: MIL-STD-1553B/1760 compatible
- **Power**: 28VDC with 2-hour battery backup

### Operational Modes
1. **Manual** - AI provides advice only
2. **Assisted** - AI acts as co-pilot
3. **Autonomous** - AI flies, human commands
4. **Emergency** - Returns injured pilot to base

### Compatible Aircraft
- F-16 Fighting Falcon (900+ aircraft)
- F-15 Eagle/Strike Eagle (400+ aircraft)
- F/A-18 Super Hornet (600+ aircraft)

- [ ] Core AI development
- [ ] Simulator integration
- [ ] Safety system design

### Phase 2: Testing (Q3 2025-Q2 2026)
- [ ] Ground testing
- [ ] Flight testing at Edwards AFB
- [ ] Pilot training program

### Phase 3: Deployment (Q3 2026+)

## ⚖️ Ethics & Compliance

This project strictly adheres to:
- DOD Directive 3000.09 on Autonomous Weapons
- Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC)
- Geneva Convention protocols
- NATO STANAG 4586

**Strategic Imperative**: With a 12,000 pilot deficit, requiring human authorization for every defensive action guarantees defeat. ARES implements graduated autonomy that scales with threat level while maintaining human command authority.
